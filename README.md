# decommenter
This plug in just removes comments from the geeksforgeeks.org website code examples.

To use in firefox, go to the options and find: 
more tools > remote debugging > this firefox and click "load temporary add on"

Then, choose any file from the plug in. It should work when you refresh the G4G page. Comments should not appear.
